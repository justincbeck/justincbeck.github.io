<p><em>March 2012 – December 2012 (10 months)</em> Charlottesville, VA</p>

<p>Designed, developed and implemented tools and processes that provided measurable improvement in both testing and release management.</p>

<p>Tools included plugins for Maven and JetBrains' TeamCity that ensure the internally tested application is, bit for bit, the same application the client sees and is, bit for bit, the same application that is submitted to Apple. These tools remove the burden of juggling certificates and provisioning profiles from the developer and centrally locate it in continuous integration while also ensuring that only code that's been tested gets shipped.</p>

<p>Processes included development of test plans and test reports and integration in to the existing development process to ensure testing is unavoidable and shipped software is of the highest quality.</p>
